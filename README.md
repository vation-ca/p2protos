eRegs Pilot2 project
=====

Planning and design preparations for second pilot of online regulatory consultations. The focus this time is on supporting public display of submitted comments. 

* [Prototype of example consultation](https://vation-ca.github.io/p2protos/p2form-1-en.html)

# Proposed policy decisions

* [Commenter names - to hide or not to hide](Decisions_names.md)
* [Commenter emails - to verify or not to verify](Decisions_emails.md)
* Display submissions - at end of consultation period, not when submitted
* Public display of submissions - by submission and by text section, or just by submission
* Accepting submissions - online only or as parallel process but no matter what, all are displayed online.
