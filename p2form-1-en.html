</div><h4><strong>REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT </strong></h4>
<p>(<em>This statement is not part of the regulations.</em>)</p><strong>Issues </strong>
<p class="alignLeft">This regulatory proposal would amend the <em>Food and Drug Regulations </em>(FDR) to address the following issues.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Lack of drug identification number requirements for Schedule<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&nbsp;</span>C drugs<br/>
</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">When Health Canada grants market authorization to a drug, a drug identification number (DIN) is issued and printed on the label of the drug. This DIN is used for a variety of regulatory purposes, including tracking of market status. Radiopharmaceuticals and drugs that are sold or represented for use in the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals (other than radionuclides) are listed in Schedule<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&nbsp;</span>C to the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em>. Schedule<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&nbsp;</span>C drugs are presently exempt from the DIN issuance requirement; thus, Health Canada does not have a mechanism to track their market authorization status and cannot easily ascertain which of them are currently available on the Canadian market. This exemption has led to difficulties finding accurate and timely information about Schedule<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&nbsp;</span>C drugs, such as identifying alternative products on the market during drug shortage situations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Discrepancies in the requirements regarding notification of 12&nbsp;months of no sale for certain DIN products<br/>
</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Health Canada&rsquo;s publicly accessible Drug Product Database (DPD) is a repository of information for all drugs authorized for sale in Canada<strong> </strong>that uses the DIN as the primary identifier. As part of the <em>Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Shortages of Drugs and Discontinuation of Sale of Drugs) </em> 
<a href="#footnote.51253" id="footnoteRef.51253">(see footnote 1)</a> [the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations], a new provision was introduced that requires manufacturers to<strong> </strong>notify Health Canada within 30&nbsp;days when a drug has not been sold for a period of 12&nbsp;months. Once Health Canada has been notified of this fact, the status of the drug in the DPD will change from &ldquo;marketed&rdquo; to &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; to better reflect the market status. With this information, practitioners can make informed decisions on treatment options for their patients. This requirement, however, only covers certain classes of drugs and does not include all DIN products, such as non-prescription drugs and veterinary drugs. As a result, discrepancies exist between the current market statuses of all classes of DIN products in the DPD. This is problematic when practitioners and patients are relying on the DPD for accurate information.

</details>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DINs for Schedule C drugs</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Radiopharmaceuticals are drugs that exhibit radioactive properties and are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Radiopharmaceuticals are listed in Schedule&nbsp;C to the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em>, along with kits for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Prior to 1998, Schedule&nbsp;C licences were issued to manufacturers annually for Schedule C drugs. Each Schedule&nbsp;C licence listed all the products that were being marketed by a manufacturer at that time, and these were renewed on an annual basis. These licences were replaced by establishment licences in 1998. Since then, Schedule&nbsp;C drugs have been required to be labelled with the establishment licence number.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">For other classes of drugs, a DIN is issued for each drug product that is authorized for sale in Canada and serves as a unique identifier that has, historically, been primarily used for reimbursement purposes by insurance companies. As most radiopharmaceuticals are administered parenterally (i.e. intravenously or via intramuscular injection) and are commonly prepared and administered by health care professionals in a clinical or hospital setting, DINs were deemed not to be required for reimbursement purposes. Therefore, Schedule&nbsp;C&nbsp;drugs were exempted from the DIN requirement.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Over time, the purpose of the DIN has evolved. Today, Health Canada uses a DIN for a variety of regulatory activities, such as the tracking of market status of a drug and displaying associated information within the public DPD. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) uses a DIN to aid in compliance and enforcement activities with respect to the importation of drugs. A manufacturer&rsquo;s authority to sell a product on the Canadian market is represented through the issuance of a DIN. Health Canada can similarly revoke the authority to sell a product that has been shown in the post-market context to be unsafe or for other reasons, such as non-compliance with the regulations, through the cancellation of a DIN.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Currently, once a DIN has been assigned, the manufacturer of the drug must provide Health Canada with a notification within 30&nbsp;days of selling a drug in Canada. By means of an Annual Drug Notification Form, the manufacturer also confirms that all the information previously supplied with respect to that drug is correct. This information is used by Health Canada for a variety of regulatory activities, such as the tracking of market status of the drug in the DPD.<br/>
As Schedule&nbsp;C drugs are currently exempt from the DIN requirement, manufacturers are not required to provide market notification or an Annual Drug Notification Form. In the absence of such information on Schedule&nbsp;C&nbsp;drugs in the DPD, it has been difficult to determine which radiopharmaceutical products are available on the Canadian market. This was particularly evident during the isotope shortages that followed the shutdowns of the Chalk&nbsp;River National Research Universal nuclear reactor facility in 2007&ndash;2008 and 2009&ndash;2010. 
<a href="#footnote.51254" id="footnoteRef.51254">(see footnote 2)</a> It was difficult for Health Canada to identify radioisotope alternatives during this shortage period due to the lack of an up-to-date list of Schedule&nbsp;C drugs on the market.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notifications to Health Canada</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Presently, when a drug product receives approval from Health Canada and is issued a DIN, it is listed on the DPD as &ldquo;approved.&rdquo; Once a manufacturer notifies Health Canada that the sale of this product has commenced, the status is changed to &ldquo;marketed.&rdquo; When the product is discontinued and the DIN cancelled, the status is changed to &ldquo;cancelled.&rdquo; If at any time the sale of the product stops, but the DIN is still active, the status of the drug remains &ldquo;marketed&rdquo; even though it is not available on the Canadian market.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Beginning in spring&nbsp;2017, a provision in the FDR will come into force as part of the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations<em> </em>that will require manufacturers (authorization holders) of certain drugs to notify Health Canada within 30&nbsp;days when a period of 12&nbsp;months of no sale has elapsed. Once this provision comes into force, a new &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; status will be introduced in the DPD. When a manufacturer notifies Health Canada that a product has not been sold for a period of 12&nbsp;months, the status of the drug in the DPD will be changed from &ldquo;marketed&rdquo; to &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; to better reflect the market status and allow the public to easily distinguish drug products that are readily available on the Canadian market.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-22" data-ref="ris-Background">

<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p class="alignLeft">The objectives of the proposed regulatory amendments are to amend the FDR to</p>
<p class="alignLeft">1.	Remove the DIN exemption and clearly outline the labelling requirements for Schedule C drugs in order to align the DIN application process and labelling requirements for Schedule C drugs with the application process and labelling requirements of all other drug products that have DINs.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">2.	Require Schedule C drug manufacturers to notify Health Canada within 30&nbsp;days of a product being marketed or discontinued.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">3.	Broaden the scope of the notification of 12&nbsp;months with no sale to require manufacturers of all DIN products not covered under the Shortage and Discontinuation Regulations to notify Health Canada after a 12-month period of no sale as part of the annual notification process.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-27" data-ref="ris-Objectives">
    <summary>Add your comments on Objectives</summary>
</details>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p class="alignLeft">The proposed amendments would remove the exemptions to DIN requirements with respect to Schedule&nbsp;C drugs, thus aligning the DIN application process and labelling requirements for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs with the application process and labelling requirements of all other drug products all other drug products for which a DIN has been assigned. It would also harmonize the requirement regarding the notification of 12&nbsp;months with no sale for all DIN products and create a means for Health Canada to maintain a current and accurate list of marketed products.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIN requirements </span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Under the proposed amendments, Part&nbsp;C of the FDR would be amended to remove the exemption from the requirement to be issued a DIN in order to be sold in Canada for all Schedule&nbsp;C drugs. In turn, manufacturers of Schedule C drugs that are currently on the market and that are sold pursuant to a notice of compliance would be required to submit an application for a DIN. When authorized, the manufacturer would be issued a Drug Notification Form, through which the DIN is assigned.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">For all other Schedule&nbsp;C new drugs in respect of which a notice of compliance has not yet been issued, manufacturers of those drugs would be required to file a new drug submission or abbreviated new drug submission as per Part&nbsp;C of the FDR and, if authorized, would be assigned a DIN.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">A second amendment to Part&nbsp;C would require that manufacturers of Schedule C drugs, like all other drugs assigned a DIN, notify Health Canada within 30&nbsp;days of commencing sale once a Drug Notification Form has been issued. Additional amendments made to Part C of the FDR would require the manufacturer to either resubmit the application or notify Health Canada should any information as part of the DIN application change.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-33" data-ref="ris-DIN Requirements">

</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Labelling requirements </span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Labelling requirements for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs in Part C of the FDR would be consistent with the requirements of all drugs for which a DIN has been assigned. Establishment licence numbers would no longer be required on product labels and would be replaced by the DIN.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-35" data-ref="ris-Labelling Requirements">
    <summary>Add your comments on Labelling Requirements</summary>
</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Distributors and distribution activities </span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">The definition of distributor found in Part&nbsp;C would be amended to reflect the issuance of DINs for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs. Likewise, the list of activities for establishment licence holders would be amended to encompass the distribution of active ingredients that are used in the making of Schedule&nbsp;C non-biologic drugs.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-37" data-ref="ris-Distributors and Distribution Activities">
    <summary>Add your comments on Distributors and Distribution Activities</summary>
</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alignment of DIN provisions </span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Currently, several provisions in Part&nbsp;C of the FDR are written in such a way that drug products with a DIN, radiopharmaceuticals, and kits for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals are listed separately. Since Schedule&nbsp;C drugs would be included in the category of drugs that have been assigned a DIN under the proposed amendments, these sections would be amended to reflect one single category of drugs.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-39" data-ref="ris-Alignment of DIN Provisions">
    <summary>Add your comments on Alignment of DIN Provisions</summary>
</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notification of 12 months with no sale<br/>
</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">When the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations come into force in spring&nbsp;2017, the provisions regarding the requirement to notify Health Canada of 12&nbsp;months with no sale will only apply to those products that meet the definition of &ldquo;drug&rdquo; under those Regulations (e.g. prescription drugs). In order to bring uniformity to the regulations, the proposed amendments would require notification for all products that have received a DIN (i.e. Health Canada would need to be notified of all drug products for which a DIN has been assigned).</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-42" data-ref="ris-12 Months with No Sale">

</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Language consistency between English and French versions of the FDR<br/>
</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">Several provisions were identified by the Department of Justice where the English and French texts are inconsistent. The following provisions would be amended in order to harmonize the wording between the English and French versions with no change to the original intent:</p>
<p class="alignLeft">C.01.005(1)</p>
<p class="alignLeft">C.01.014.2(1)(a)(i) and (ii)</p>

</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consequential amendments &mdash; Assignment and cancellation of drug identification numbers</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">In order to accurately reflect how the regulations have been administered and eliminate unnecessary language, references to &ldquo;the importer&rdquo; and to &ldquo;a person authorized by a manufacturer&rdquo; would be removed from the provisions regarding the assignment and cancellation of DINs. References to &ldquo;the manufacturer&rdquo; would be aligned with those found in the provisions regarding drug shortages and discontinuations. These proposed amendments aim to improve the wording of the regulations without changing the original intent or the current operational process.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">The provision regarding the annual notification process would be amended to specify the information to be submitted as part of the notification. This proposed amendment aims to bring more transparency to the regulations with respect to the manufacturer&rsquo;s obligation without changing the original intent or current practice.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consequential amendments &mdash; Drug shortage and discontinuation provisions</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">With the proposed addition of DIN requirements for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs, the recent amendments to the FDR concerning drug shortages and discontinuations would be updated to reflect this change.

Current fees levied to Schedule&nbsp;C drug manufacturers, such as the New Drug Submission fee and the Establishment Licence fee, would continue to apply with no change to the fee level. This would be a temporary measure until a review of the Fee Regulations could be undertaken, in compliance with the <em>User Fees Act</em>, to expand the scope of the fees related to possession of a DIN to encompass Schedule C drugs.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-56" data-ref="ris-Consequential Amendments">

<p class="alignLeft">If an application for a DIN is submitted within 6&nbsp;months of the proposed amendments coming into force, and a Drug Notification Form, which contains the DIN, is issued, the drug could continue to be sold with the pre-DIN label for 12&nbsp;months or, in the case of a kit, 24&nbsp;months after the issued date of the final decision.</p>

<p class="alignLeft">The &ldquo;One-for-One&rdquo; Rule applies to this proposal and would be considered an &ldquo;IN.&rdquo; The annual administrative cost of completing and submitting the Annual Drug Notification Form is expected to be $56 per product. Approximately 250&nbsp;Schedule&nbsp;C drugs are estimated to be on the market, and the total administrative cost is expected to be $14,000 on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Additionally, manufacturers of remaining DIN products not included in previous amendments within the FDR would be required to notify Health Canada if their product has not been sold for a period of 12 months. There is an estimated backlog of 1 150&nbsp;dormant DIN products, and 200&nbsp;dormant products are anticipated to be reported annually. The administrative cost to notify is expected to be $75,600 the first year, and $11,200 every year thereafter, if done separately from the annual notification process. However, since industry will be able to notify Health Canada of dormant products through the annual notification process, these costs are expected to be much lower.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">The net present value of these administrative costs over 10&nbsp;years is $249,571, or $190,396 in 2012&nbsp;dollars. The annualized cost, in 2012&nbsp;dollars, is $19,225.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-66" data-ref="ris-“One-for-One” Rule">

<p class="alignLeft">In July&nbsp;2007, a notice of intent outlining Health Canada&rsquo;s intent to develop regulations to remove the DIN exemption for Schedule C drugs was published in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>,<em> </em>Part&nbsp;I. During the 30-day&nbsp;consultation period, two comments were received from industry stakeholders, and both were supportive of the proposal. Stakeholders did not express any concerns regarding the potential for an increased burden associated with a DIN application and confirmed that there would not be any undue financial burden with respect to changing labels, given that non-DIN labelled products could continue to be sold during the transition period.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">On September&nbsp;20, 2011, Health Canada sent a letter to radiopharmaceutical stakeholders to inform them and solicit their input regarding the proposed changes for the DIN requirements for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs. Their feedback was positive.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Throughout the development of the proposed amendments, Health Canada has communicated with industry via regular stakeholder meetings and workshops. These meetings include a biannual meeting with the Nuclear Medicine Alliance, a group representing nuclear medicine companies, as well as a biannual meeting with the Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine and the Canadian Association of Radiopharmaceutical Scientists, representing non-industry radiopharmaceutical stakeholders. Health Canada will continue to provide information and updates to stakeholders through its annual Radiopharmaceutical Regulatory Workshops.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">A survey regarding the notification of no sale after 12&nbsp;months for products that do not fall under the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations was sent out to stakeholders on July&nbsp;19, 2016. Respondents indicated that, while supportive of the proposal to expand the scope to capture all products assigned a DIN, the burden of notifying Health Canada would be greatly reduced if it were possible to do so as part of the annual notification process. Health Canada agrees, and the proposal has been amended so that products captured under the definition of drug by the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations will continue to be required to be reported within 30 days after a period of 12&nbsp;months of no sale has elapsed, while all other products assigned a DIN would be required to be reported as part of the annual notification process.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-72" data-ref="ris-Justification">

</details>
<strong>Rationale </strong>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DINs for Schedule C drugs </span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">All drugs in dosage form, other than Schedule&nbsp;C drugs, regulated under the FDR have a DIN assigned upon authorization by Health Canada which must appear on the product label. Not requiring that a DIN be assigned to Schedule&nbsp;C drugs has given rise to a number of regulatory inconsistencies. Specifically, Schedule&nbsp;C drugs are not required to be reported to Health Canada once their sale on the Canadian market has begun, nor are notices required to be given when sales of radiopharmaceuticals are discontinued. Furthermore, since no mechanism exists to cancel a notice of compliance (the type of market authorization that Schedule&nbsp;C drugs receive), Health Canada does not have the authority to cancel market authorizations for these drugs. Under this proposal, Schedule&nbsp;C drugs would be subject to the same requirements, such as market notification and discontinuance of sales notification, as all DIN products. This would bring the regulatory oversight of these products into alignment with other products that have been assigned a DIN.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Despite the addition of Schedule&nbsp;C drugs to the DPD in 2015, the information within the database is still incomplete. Affected stakeholders may be unable to find adequate information relating to available alternatives when faced with a possible drug shortage. As the DPD is a publicly available database, this proposal would make market status information for Schedule C drugs available to physicians and other health care stakeholders. This is an important mitigation measure during shortages, discontinuations, and when a drug is not sold for a period of 12&nbsp;months or more. Additionally, a DIN for Schedule&nbsp;C drugs would allow for easier identification, monitoring, and recall of these products. For example, the CBSA could access the DPD for complete and reliable information to aid in compliance activities and law enforcement in terms of drug importation. Health care institutions (hospitals and clinics) could easily identify affected drugs during product recall situations.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">The proposed amendments would also bring Schedule&nbsp;C drugs into the scope of products more readily eligible for reimbursement through public and private insurance. Some stakeholders identified the lack of a DIN as being the primary reason why some insurers would refuse a claim.<em><br/>
 </em></p>
<p class="alignLeft">The change in labelling requirements associated with this proposal is expected to result in costs of $1,000&nbsp;per product, considering a sufficient coming-into-force period to reduce the costs associated with packaging change. Assuming that there are 250&nbsp;radiopharmaceuticals currently authorized to be marketed in Canada, this requirement is expected to result in a one-time cost of $250,000. The proposal would also require manufacturers to fill out and submit a DIN application form and market notification, as well as an Annual Drug Notification Form to confirm that the information previously supplied with regard to the product is correct. This would cost industry $28,000 the first year, and $14,000&nbsp;every year thereafter. The cost to Health Canada of issuing and processing DINs is conservatively estimated to be $35,360. Proposed amendments to add remission provisions to the Fee Regulations would ensure that there would not be any new or higher user fees paid by manufacturers of Schedule&nbsp;C products. These fees, expected to add up to $282,000&nbsp;annually, would instead be absorbed by Health Canada until consultations take place and user fees can be updated in accordance with the <em>User Fees Act</em>.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-79" data-ref="ris-DINs Rationale">

</details>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notifications to Health Canada</span></p>
<p class="alignLeft">As of spring of 2017, new regulatory rules will require manufacturers to notify Health Canada within 30&nbsp;days when a period of 12&nbsp;months of no sale has elapsed. Once this provision comes into force, it will only apply to certain classes of drugs, but not to all DIN products. This will create discrepancies in the DPD where some products with active DINs not being sold in Canada will have a status of &ldquo;marketed&rdquo; while others will have a status of &ldquo;dormant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="alignLeft">The proposed amendment would align all DIN products in the DPD by broadening the scope of the notification to require manufacturers of all DIN products to notify Health Canada after a 12-month&nbsp;period of no sale within 30&nbsp;days for drugs captured under the definition of drug by the Shortages and Discontinuation Regulations and as part of the annual notification process for all other products that have been assigned a DIN. It would allow Health Canada to clearly and easily distinguish between products that have been granted an authorization to be sold in Canada but are not actively being sold, and those that are presently available for sale on the Canadian market. Having this distinction on Health Canada&rsquo;s website will help patients, health care practitioners, and other health care stakeholders to have a clear and current picture of which drugs are available on the Canadian market. Furthermore, it would allow DIN holders to maintain their DIN in the event that they decide to resume marketing their product.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">There are approximately 1&nbsp;150&nbsp;DIN products which are not actively being sold, and it is expected that there will be 200&nbsp;dormant products annually. Notifying Health Canada of these products is expected to cost industry&nbsp;$75,600 the first year, and $11,200&nbsp;every year thereafter, if done separately from the annual notification process. However, since industry will be able to notify Health Canada of dormant products through the annual notification process, these costs are expected to be much lower.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">Health Canada will be required to process this backlog of notifications at a cost of $34,466 the first year, as well as the notifications for 200 dormant products every year thereafter, at a cost of $6,894&nbsp;per year.</p>
<p class="alignLeft">The benefits of this proposal, as stated above, are expected to outweigh the costs to industry of applying for DINs, changing labels and notifying Health Canada following a period of no sale, as well as the costs to Health Canada for processing and issuing said DINs, and processing notifications for dormant DIN products.</p><details class="addcomment" id="ris-85" data-ref="ris-Notifications Rationale">
