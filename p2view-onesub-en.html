marketplace. Although we understand and support these intended objectives, the third little pig builds a house of bricks. The wolf fails to blow down the house. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time.

			<td class="lrg-table"><a href=''></a>RIS-85 Notifications rationale</td>
			<td class="lrg-table">SUPPLY CHAIN REALITIES
Supply chains are lengthy and complicated, involving entities such as the manufacturing sites, importers,
distributors, wholesalers, storage warehouses, cross-dock warehouses, retailers, pharmacies, health care
facilities, health care professional offices, patients and consumers. The regulations require the authorization
holders (i.e. manufacturers/DIN owners) notify of a situation where they have not sold the product in the last 12
months.


Authorization holders are the first legal entities to sell the drug product to any of the entities listed above. Each
other entity, in turn, sells the product to another entity, and so forth down the supply chain to the ultimate
patient/customer. Reflecting on these realities, reporting based on “no-sale” by the authorization holder will
by no means reflect which drugs are “available for sale” as it simply focuses on the entry point into supply chains.
Given product expiry dates can be anywhere from 1 to 4 years or even more, product can be “on-shelf” (i.e.
available for sale) many months after the authorization holder has not sold the product for 12 months after they
have first sold the product. In this regard, we submit that modifying the corresponding “status” of the DPD on
this basis, will provide no clearer or current picture of which drugs are available on the market, nor does it
provide an accurate depiction of the market status as proposed.


DPD AS A TOOL FOR COMMUNICATING DRUG AVAILABILITY


The underlying premise to these proposed revised amendments appears to suggest that the DPD is inaccurate.
We would submit that this would depend on how the information as outlined therein is being interpreted and
used. As we understand it, the ‘status’ fields within the DPD are intended simply to indicate products that have
been registered (DIN issued) and authorized (notification of sale). To our knowledge, the DPD was never
intended to be used as a tool to identify whether a product is available at any given time in the Canadian marketplace or not; but rather is simply a record of those products that have been authorized and undergone
the appropriate regulatory submissions to support their legal sale in Canada. In this regard, we believe the
information in the DPD is sufficiently accurate for this intended purpose.
In proposing these amendments, Health Canada appears to be suggesting expanding the scope of the DPD,
beyond its original intent, thereby indicate that the information as outlined therein is inaccurate; when in fact,
it is the interpretation and misunderstanding of the specific nature of the information as contained therein that
requires clarification. This proposal suggests that stakeholders should be using the DPD as a source of
identifying whether a drug product is “available for sale” or not, when we would submit that this is an
inappropriate use of the information as outlined therein. Were this to be the case, and for such a tool to be
effective, we would submit that the database would need to be significantly overhauled to include information
as to provinces/regions/municipalities and establishments where product can in fact be accessed. Only in this
regard would the proposed objectives and ‘clear’ picture as outlined be truly met for all stakeholders.
Alternatively, we would suggest that it be more appropriate for Health Canada to consider some outreach
materials that explains more appropriately what the ‘status’ fields represent within the context of the DPD. We
believe that this would go a long way to clarify any misinterpretation of the information as contained therein.
APPLICABILITY AND RELEVANCE TO ALL DRUG PRODUCTS
Finally, we would like to again re-iterate our support for such measures in the context of prescription (and
certain non-prescription) drug products, to extend these measures to all drug products is rather nonsensical.
Consumers are not using the DPD to identify whether a low-risk drug product is “available for sale” in Canada or
not. These purchasing decisions are made at the store and certainly any corresponding ‘access’ considerations
would not be considered life-threating or of serious consequence such that ‘more accurate’ knowledge would
be necessary to inform stakeholders. In this regard, we submit that these amendments would merely add to
existing regulatory burdens without any meaningful return or benefits to any stakeholder.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
CA strongly believes that the proposed dormancy measures as outlined will NOT result in any more granularity
or accuracy of the information on the market status of a drug within the context of the DPD. If the goal of these
measures is truly to ensure stakeholders have access to a tool to assist in understanding whether a certain drug
product is “available for sale” or not, we submit that it may be more appropriate to consider other measures
outside the context of the DPD, and one that will in fact be focused on reflecting the overall drug supply chain
and not simply focused on the DIN owner. In this regard, we do not understand or support how the proposed
dormancy measures will in fact deliver on the overall intent of the proposed amendment. As such, we
respectfully recommend that these measures be dropped from further consideration OR at a minimum that
additional consultations be pursued to determine a more appropriate vehicle for delivering on this intent.
Finally, we would strongly recommend that any such measures be limited only to a subset of drug products for
which such ‘availability’ information would be considered necessary to support sound healthcare decisions.
Applying such measures to sunscreens and other low-risk drug products and to suggest that consumers make
use of the DPD to supplement these decisions seems greatly out of step with reality. We trust that on this basis,
the scope of these amendments can be re-visited to reflect the limited scope of drugs as reflected originally in
the June 2016 amendments.
Z continues to support the development of regulations which are appropriate for individual product types
and commensurate with risk. Accordingly, we strongly support the focus of the drug shortages provisions as
outlined under these amendments on only a subset of “authorization holders”. We would suggest that similar
limitations also be applicable to the dormancy reporting provisions.
